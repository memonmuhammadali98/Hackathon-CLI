# Research: Update Todo Item

**Feature Branch**: `001-update-todo-item`  
**Created**: 2025-12-27  

## Phase 0 Research Findings

For the "Update Todo Item" feature within the in-memory CLI application, no complex technical unknowns or significant ambiguities were identified that require external research at this planning stage.

The design relies on existing project conventions for Python CLI applications, in-memory data management, and `pytest` for testing. The constraints (in-memory, no persistence, single-user context for Phase I) simplify the technical approach, meaning no deeper research into distributed systems, complex data models, or advanced performance optimizations is necessary at this time.

All `NEEDS CLARIFICATION` markers were addressed during the specification phase or are covered by existing project context.
